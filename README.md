# COVID 19 in England - assorted data and visualisation
---
Hello!

This is my assorted set of data and visualisations about the COVID 19 emergency in England.

I'm focussing on how COVID is developing in Upper Tier Local Authorities, starting with some static maps showing daily growth in cases nationally and in English Regions.

For conveniences, I have stitched the daily images into a 90 second animated GIF
